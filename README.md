# zx-asm-fire

Fire demo written in Z80 Assembly for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum.

It's been more than 10 years since I wrote Z80 assembler for the last time (as of December 2023), so I tried to do a quick exercise just to see if I still remembered all the opcodes, hacks & tricks.

You can download the TAP file [here](https://github.com/sromeroi/zx-asm-fire/raw/main/fire.tap) (not even 1KB, generated from less than 300 lines of Z80 assembly code).

You can see how the fire starts and runs for ~25 seconds with the sample GIF below:

Of course, it runs perfectly on the original computer, but also on FPGAs, emulators, etc.

Thanks to **Javier Ar√©valo** (**Jare**) for sharing with us in 1993 his FIRE.EXE/ASM (packed along with Jester's ELYSIUM.MOD) for our PCs.
