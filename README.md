# zx-asm-fire

Fire demo written in Z80 Assembly for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum.

It's been almost 20 years since I wrote Z80 assembler for the last time (as of December 2023), so I tried to do a quick exercise just to see if I still remembered all the opcodes, hacks & tricks.

You can download the TAP file [here](https://github.com/sromeroi/zx-asm-fire/raw/main/fire.tap) (just 936 bytes).

You can see how the fire starts and runs for ~25 seconds with the sample GIF below:

Of course, it runs perfectly con the original computer, but also on FPGAs, emulators, etc.
